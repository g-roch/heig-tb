	abstract = {E-voting has the potential to lower participation thresholds and increase turnout, but its technical complexity may produce other barriers to participation. Using Rogers' theory of the diffusion of innovations, we examined how the use of e-voting has changed over time. Data from eight e-enabled elections between 2005 and 2015 in Estonia, were used to investigate changes to the profile of e-voters and contrast them to those voting by conventional means. Owing to the aggregate share of e-voters increasing with each election, with one third of voters now casting their vote remotely over the internet, there was a lack of conclusive evidence regarding whether the new voting technology had diffused homogenously among the voting population, or remained a channel for the resourceful and privileged. Our findings show that diffusion has taken place, but not until after the first three e-enabled elections. Thus, internet voting has the potential to be used by a wide range of voter types, bridge societal divisions, and emerge as an inclusive innovative voting technology.},

	title = {What proof do we prefer? Variants of veriﬁability in voting},
	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss one particular feature of Internet voting, veriﬁability, against the background of scientiﬁc literature and experiments in the Netherlands. In order to conceptually clarify what veriﬁability is about, we distinguish classical veriﬁability from constructive veriﬁability in both individual and universal veriﬁcation. In classical individual veriﬁability, a proof that a vote has been counted can be given without revealing the vote. In constructive individual veriﬁability, a proof is only accepted if the witness (i.e. the vote) can be reconstructed. Analogous concepts are deﬁned for universal veriﬁability of the tally. The {RIES} system used in the Netherlands establishes constructive individual veriﬁability and constructive universal veriﬁability, whereas many advanced cryptographic systems described in the scientiﬁc literature establish classical individual veriﬁability and classical universal veriﬁability.},
