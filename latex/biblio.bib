C'est le système électoral proportionnel le plus répandu parmi les États indépendants et les territoires semi-autonomes qui tiennent des élections parlementaires au scrutin direct. Il est né au {XIXe} siècle avec l'apparition des partis politiques. Il semble que l'inventeur de la représentation proportionnelle soit Victor Considerant, dans un ouvrage paru en 1846. Les premiers systèmes pour le mettre en place ont d'abord été proposés par des mathématiciens et portent souvent le nom de leurs auteurs. La Belgique fut la première à adopter le scrutin proportionnel pour ses députés en 1899 (méthode D'Hondt élaborée par Victor D'Hondt).},

The phenomenon known as the Condorcet effect or the Condorcet paradox is the well-known problem of the simple majority rule. The paradox bearing the name of Borda is less commonly known, but it also relates to a procedure that is widely used, namely the plurality principle. Either one of these paradoxes is serious enough to make these procedures suspect unless one is convinced that the situations giving rise to these paradoxical features are extremely rare. In this article we review some voting procedures that have been introduced in the literature. We aim at giving a synthesis of the assessments of procedures with respect to various criteria.},

	abstract = {An end-to-end verifiable (E2E) voting system enables candidates, voters and observers to monitor the integrity of an election process and verify the results without relying on trusted systems. In this paper, we propose a {DRE}-based Borda count e-voting system called {DRE}-Borda. The proposed system is E2E verifiable without involving any tallying authorities. Furthermore, it outputs only the total score a candidate gets without revealing any other information such as the breakdown of scores with respect to different ranks. This reduces the information leakage from the tallying result to the minimum, hence effectively preventing Italian attacks. When the {DRE} machine is completely compromised, the integrity of the tallying result is still preserved and what an adversary can learn from a compromised machine is strictly limited to the partial tally at the time of compromise.},

	abstract = {E-voting has the potential to lower participation thresholds and increase turnout, but its technical complexity may produce other barriers to participation. Using Rogers' theory of the diffusion of innovations, we examined how the use of e-voting has changed over time. Data from eight e-enabled elections between 2005 and 2015 in Estonia, were used to investigate changes to the profile of e-voters and contrast them to those voting by conventional means. Owing to the aggregate share of e-voters increasing with each election, with one third of voters now casting their vote remotely over the internet, there was a lack of conclusive evidence regarding whether the new voting technology had diffused homogenously among the voting population, or remained a channel for the resourceful and privileged. Our findings show that diffusion has taken place, but not until after the first three e-enabled elections. Thus, internet voting has the potential to be used by a wide range of voter types, bridge societal divisions, and emerge as an inclusive innovative voting technology.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss one particular feature of Internet voting, veriﬁability, against the background of scientiﬁc literature and experiments in the Netherlands. In order to conceptually clarify what veriﬁability is about, we distinguish classical veriﬁability from constructive veriﬁability in both individual and universal veriﬁcation. In classical individual veriﬁability, a proof that a vote has been counted can be given without revealing the vote. In constructive individual veriﬁability, a proof is only accepted if the witness (i.e. the vote) can be reconstructed. Analogous concepts are deﬁned for universal veriﬁability of the tally. The {RIES} system used in the Netherlands establishes constructive individual veriﬁability and constructive universal veriﬁability, whereas many advanced cryptographic systems described in the scientiﬁc literature establish classical individual veriﬁability and classical universal veriﬁability.},
